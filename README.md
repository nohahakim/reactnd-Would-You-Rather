# Would You Rather Project

This project is an assessment project for  Udacity's React & Redux course. The project is a "Would You Rather?" game played by the user. The user is asked a question in the form of "Would You Rather? and is given two options. It is against the rules of the game if both questions or neither of them is chosen. Using this app, the user can answer, see the answered and unanswered questions, create questions, see other user's votes and ranking on the leaderboard.
